# Qrates: Analysing Rust Code Corpus

**Qrates** is a tool for running large scale analysis of Rust code. In case you are curious what you can do with **Qrates**, you can find the Jupyter notebooks we produced for our paper “How Do Programmers Use Unsafe Rust?” [here](./reports) (the CSV files are available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4026639)).

[The documentation](https://rust-corpus.github.io/qrates/) explains how **Qrates** works and shows examples of how to use it on both public and private code bases. If you would like to use some part of **Qrates** as a library, you can find the API documentation [here](https://rust-corpus.github.io/qrates/doc/corpus_manager/index.html).
